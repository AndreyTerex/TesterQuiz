# üöÄ TesterQuiz: My First Java Web App

Welcome to TesterQuiz! This is my educational project, created to practice and demonstrate my skills in Java web development. I built it from scratch to learn how to create a full-featured web application.

## üå± What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to dive deep into the following technologies and concepts:

*   **Core Java & Backend Logic:** Building the application's foundation with Java.
*   **Servlets & JSP:** Handling web requests and creating dynamic web pages.
*   **JSTL:** Simplifying JSP pages and keeping the code clean.
*   **Database Interaction:** Working with a file-based database to store user and test data.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implementing a secure login system with user roles.
*   **Maven:** Managing project dependencies and the build process.
*   **Tomcat:** Deploying and running the application on a real web server.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **User System:** Users can register and log in.
*   **Role-Based Access:** Separate functionalities for regular `USER`s and `ADMIN`s.
*   **Quiz Engine:** Users can take tests and see their scores.
*   **Admin Panel:** Admins can create, edit, and delete tests and questions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Java, Servlets, JSP, JSTL
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
*   **Build Tool:** Maven
*   **Web Server:** Tomcat
